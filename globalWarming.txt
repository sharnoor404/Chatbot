Global warming is the ongoing rise of the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.It is a major aspect of climate change which, in addition to rising global surface temperatures,also includes its effects, such as changes in precipitation.While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming,observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale.


Observed temperature from NASA vs the 1850–1900 average used by the IPCC as a pre-industrial baseline.The primary driver for increased global temperatures in the industrial era is human activity, with natural forces adding variability.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that "human influence on climate has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century".[9] These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of major nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.[10] The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases, with over 90% of the impact from carbon dioxide and methane.[11] Fossil fuel burning is the principal source of these gases, with agricultural emissions and deforestation also playing significant roles.[12] Climate sensitivity to these gases is impacted by feedbacks, such as loss of snow cover, increased water vapour, and melting permafrost.[13]

Land surfaces are heating faster than the ocean surface,[6] leading to heat waves, wildfires, and the expansion of deserts.[14] Increasing atmospheric energy and rates of evaporation are causing more intense storms and weather extremes, damaging infrastructure and agriculture.[15] Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic and have contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice.[16] Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.[17] Surface temperatures would stabilize and decline a little if emissions were cut off, but other impacts will continue for centuries, including rising sea levels from melting ice sheets, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification from elevated levels of carbon dioxide.[18][19]

Some effects of climate change

Farmland loss. Droughts, rising temperatures, loss of glacial-fed rivers, and extreme weather compromise human agriculture.


Mitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, forest preservation, as well as the development of potential climate engineering technologies. Societies and governments are also working to adapt to current and future global warming impacts, including improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops.

Countries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has near-universal membership. The goal of the convention is to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".[21] The IPCC has stressed the need to keep global warming below 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) compared to pre-industrial levels in order to avoid some irreversible impacts.[22] With current policies and pledges, global warming by the end of the century is expected to reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F).[23] At the current greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate, the emissions budget for staying below 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) would be exhausted by 2028.[24]
Multiple independently produced instrumental datasets confirm that the 2009–2018 decade was 0.93 ± 0.07 °C (1.67 ± 0.13 °F) warmer than the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[27] Currently, surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C (0.36 °F) per decade.[28] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.[29] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, were not as synchronous as current warming, but may have reached temperatures as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.[30] The observed rise in temperature and CO
2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events that took place in Earth's history do not approach current rates.[31]

Climate proxy records show that natural variations offset the early effects of the Industrial Revolution, so there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century,[32] when thermometer records began to provide global coverage.[33] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted the baseline reference period 1850–1900 as an approximation of pre-industrial global mean surface temperature.[32]

The warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, documented by many independent scientific groups.[34] Although the most common measure of global warming is the increase in the near-surface atmospheric temperature, over 90% of the additional energy in the climate system over the last 50 years has been stored in the ocean, warming it.[35] The remainder of the additional energy has melted ice and warmed the continents and the atmosphere.[36] The ocean heat uptake drives thermal expansion which has contributed to observed sea level rise.[37] Further indicators of climate change include an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice and increased atmospheric humidity.[38] Flora and fauna also portray behaviour consistent with warming, such as the earlier timing of spring events,[39] such as the flowering of plants.[40]
Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying by region. Since the pre-industrial period, global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average temperatures.[41] This is due to the larger heat capacity of oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.[42] Patterns of warming are independent of the locations of greenhouse gas emissions because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet; however, localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming.[43]

The Northern Hemisphere and North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more snow area and sea ice, because of how the land masses are arranged around the Arctic Ocean. As these surfaces flip from being reflective to dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat. The Southern Hemisphere already had little sea ice in summer before it started warming.[44] Arctic temperatures have increased and are predicted to continue to increase during this century at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.[45] As the temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator decreases, ocean currents that are driven by that temperature difference, like the Gulf Stream, weaken.[46]
Although record-breaking years attract considerable media attention, individual years are less significant than the overall global surface temperature, which is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlie long-term trends.[47] An example of such an episode is the slower rate of surface temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, which was described as the global warming hiatus.[48] Throughout this period, ocean heat storage continued to progress steadily upwards, and in subsequent years, surface temperatures have spiked upwards. The slower pace of warming can be attributed to a combination of natural fluctuations, reduced solar activity, and increased reflection sunlight of by particles from volcanic eruptions.[49]
